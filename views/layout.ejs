		Stylesheets and Preprocessors
		==============================

		You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
		using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage 
		of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

		By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
		here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
		are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
		a single file.
		
		To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
		For example, here are a few things you could do:
		
		+ Change the order of your CSS files
		+ Import stylesheets from other directories
		+ Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

		Client-side Templates
		========================

		HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
		To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
		that you load these templates client-side.

		By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
		client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
		include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).
		
		To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
		For example, here are a few things you could do:

		+ Import templates from other directories
		+ Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
		+ Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
		stringfile before they're served.

		Client-side Javascript
		========================

		You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
		on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can 
		take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

		By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
		automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
		CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
		and concatenated into a single file.
		
		To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
		For example, here are a few things you could do:
		
		+ Change the order of your scripts
		+ Import scripts from other directories
		+ Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
